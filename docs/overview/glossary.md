# Glossary

- __Data request__: a digital document declaring one or more data
  sources and how data coming from those sources can be normalized and
  combined together in order to present it as a single data point to be
  consumed by other programs.

- __Decentralized network__: an overlay network in which multiple
  untrusted and independently operated computers have been set to
  communicate with each other as peers using a network protocol, with
  the purpose of fulfilling some common utility, without any of them
  having prominent or absolute control over the network and without
  chance for anyone to disrupt the functioning of the network.
  
- __Nanowit__: also _nWit_, the billionth fraction of a wit token.
  That is, 1 x 10âˆ’9 wit in scientific notation or standard form.
  One nanowit is the minimum amount of value that can exist on its own
  in the Witnet protocol, i.e. you cannot divide wits any further,
  just like you cannot divide dollars or euros further than cents.

- __Oracle__: an entity providing smart contracts with information from
  outside their containing network. Tamper resistance is the main point
  of smart contracts, so they should only employ decentralized oracles
  in which they do not need to _trust the messenger_. Otherwise, the
  oracle entity would become a _single point of failure_ that would
  defeat the purpose of using smart contracts in the first place.

- __Smart contract__: a deterministic computer program with a high
  degree of resistance to tampering and censorship due to its concurrent
  execution by a decentralized network of processors owned by
  independent, untrusted parties whose incentives deter them from
  colluding to alter the output of the program.
